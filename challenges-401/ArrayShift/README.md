# Challenge Summary
Insert a value into the middle index of the given array using Java.

## Challenge Description
The task is to write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach is to create a new array, which will contain the original and the passed values. Since we are creating a new array that will hold N values, space complexity is 0(n). The time complexity for the function is 0(n) since we are looping through the array.
