# Singly Linked List
Implemented a singly linked list data structure.

## Challenge
Create a LinkedList and Node classes under src folder for singly linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a Node class with corresponding constructors and a LinkedList class with methods and constructors. Methods:
1. insert - 0(1). The value is inserted at the start of the list.
2. includes - 0(n). Searching involves looping through the list.
3. print - 0(n). Looping through all nodes.

## API
### Initialization
Creates a null list. Example: LinkedList sample = new LinkedList();
### Methods:
#### 1. insert 
Method to insert value to the list. Parameter is the value to be inserted.
#### 2. includes
Method to find if a value exist. Parameter is the value to be searched.
#### 3. print
Method to print all values in the list. No parameter to pass. Returns list of values.
